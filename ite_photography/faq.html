                        <li id="one">1. What type of camera do you use to take your shots?

<p>-Depending. most of my recent shoots are all taken using a DSLR Canon,
the older pictures are taken using a normal digital camera</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="two">2. Do you do shoots for models?

<p>-Yes/No. I choose people whom i shoot for. And depending on the situation I sometimes will pay
for the models that I take pictures of.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="three">3. Do you use natural lighting or artificial?

<p>-I use both.. depending on the situation and subject.. usually i prefer natural lighting as it gives the photo subject a more natural and realistic take.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="four">4. Can I be your assistant?

<p>-For now i am not looking for any assistant but well you can work part-time alongside me for some of my world trips to far away places. if there is any you will recieve an email if you are interested please do leave your contact information in the feedback form on the contact page.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="five">5. Can you review/critique my portfolio, tell me what you think and give me some tips?

<p>-Yes. i will be willing to spare some time mulling over with you on your portfolio or photography projects and if you will find some of my feedback usefull that will ofcourse be for the best. it's in me to think that sparking interest in such a role as a photographer will hopefully inspire others to push for even further heights. so feel free to email your portfolio as an attachment and i will get back to you in the next 24hr or so.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="six">6. I am an artist, can I make a painting/artwork based on one of your photographs?

<p>-Yes, if it isnt for profit but on one condition that you sent me a picture of the completed artwork. I will love to share a gallery of proposed art pieces that are abstract or a inspiration from my own photo which i consider art as well.</p>
